<h1>We are SYNCD</h1>

<p>We are making a personal tool that leverages Conversational AI to help you achieve your goals around health, fitness, productivity, and more!</p>

<!-- <p>It's extremely simple, and breaks down the most <a href="https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/blob/master/examples/llama.py">complex</a> <a href="https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad/blob/master/examples/stable_diffusion.py">networks</a> into 4 <a href="https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad/blob/master/tinygrad/ops.py">OpTypes</a></p>

<li><b>UnaryOps</b> operate on one tensor and run elementwise. RELU, LOG, RECIPROCAL, etc...</li>
<li><b>BinaryOps</b> operate on two tensors and run elementwise to return one. ADD, MUL, etc...</li>
<li><b>ReduceOps</b> operate on one tensor and return a smaller tensor. SUM, MAX</li>
<li><b>MovementOps</b> operate on one tensor and move the data around, copy-free with <a href="https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/blob/master/tinygrad/shape/shapetracker.py">ShapeTracker</a>. RESHAPE, PERMUTE, EXPAND, etc...</li>

<p>But how...where are your CONVs and MATMULs? Read the code to solve this mystery.</p>

<h2>Work at the tiny corp</h2>

We <a href="https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2023/05/24/the-tiny-corp-raised-5M.html">are now funded</a> and <b>hiring</b> full time software engineers. Very talented interns okay.<br/>

See <b>jobs that need doing</b> to judge if you might be a good fit.<br/><br/>

I'm supposed to pitch you emotionally on why you should work here.<br/>
It will give you that meaning you are searching for, and I'm only half kidding.<br/>
We are actually trying to make AI for everyone.<br/><br/>

<h2>Jobs that need doing</h2>

If you come work here, this is a list to get started. Assumes some familiarity with the <a href="https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad">tinygrad</a> codebase.

<h3>Getting AMD on MLPerf</h3>
There's a <a href="https://github.com/users/geohot/projects/2">GitHub project</a> for this. Can you make the models train?<br/>
$500 per model to get tinygrad to train from scratch to the required error within 12 hours.<br/>
Learn more in the #mlperf-bounties channel on our <a href="https://discord.gg/ZjZadyC7PK">Discord</a><br/>

<h3>Fastest Stable Diffusion and LLaMA on M1</h3>
For LLaMA: Write the specializedjit and support int8.<br/>
For Stable Diffusion: Clean up to use BS=2, write winograd conv and kernel search. Target is 0.324 s/it on M1 Max.<br/>

<h3>Qualcomm DSP Support</h3>
Switch over comma's DSP based driver monitoring model to tinygrad.<br/>
A new architecture to port!</br>

<h3>Max out all the GEMMs</h3>
NVIDIA: Support local memory tensors. Some work in <a href="https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/pull/557">this branch</a>.<br/>
Apple M1: Support using Tensor Cores and simdgroup_float8x8. Some work in <a href="https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/pull/728">this branch</a>.<br/>
AMD: Write assembly backend for the linearizer<br/>

<h3>Multi GPU training</h3>
Trees, rings, and collnets oh my! AMD gets us P2P for free.

<h3>Kernel Search</h3>
There's a ton of ways to generate equivalent kernels, enumerate them and search them.<br/>
Maybe with ML based search running in tinygrad. Self improvement?

<h3>Kernel Combining (lazy.py)</h3>
ResNets don't fuse as nicely as they could because which reduce do you fuse the elementwise with?<br/>
BatchNorm at training and GroupNorm always is 4 kernels. Merge them!

<h2>FAQ:</h2>

<em>Why should I use Syncd</em><br/></br>
Have you ever been lost on how to work towards your goals? Frustrated with the overhead of looking for advice and coaching on the internet that is only somewhat related to your situation? Syncd aims to provide that coaching advice that is more tailored to your needs and in the format of a conversation.
<br/><br/><br/>

<em>Is Syncd used anywhere?</em><br/></br>
Not yet, still in development! We hope to have a demo out shortly. 
<br/><br/><br/>

<!-- <em>Is tinygrad inference only?</em><br/></br>
No! It supports full forward and backward passes with autodiff. <a href="https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/blob/master/tinygrad/mlops.py">This</a> is implemented at a level of abstraction higher than the accelerator specific code, so a tinygrad port gets you this for free.
<br/><br/><br/> -->

<em>How should I use Syncd?</em><br/></br>
The next time you have a new goal in mind and want to come up with a program/regimen to achieve it, use Syncd to get that tailored plan by explaining your situation!
<br/><br/><br/>

<em>When will Syncd leave alpha?</em><br/></br>
We plan on having a stable release by June 2024.
<br/><br/><br/>

<em>I'm a coach, can I work with Syncd?</em><br/></br>
Yes! It is important to understand that a key component of coaching is human interaction, and Syncd is not a replacement for that. However, Syncd can help you come up with tailored plans for your clients with your input, while allowing you to potentially scale to a larger audience.

<br/><br/><br/>

<em>What's the goal of Syncd?</em><br/></br>

The underlying purpose of creating Syncd is to accessibly provide guidance and cultivate intentionality in an individuals pursuit of starting a new activity or working towards a goal without any overhead. Whether it may be creating a productive morning routine, or training to run a marathon while maintaining your physique, or even preparing to climb Mt. Everest, having direction and purpose never
